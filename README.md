# ðŸ›’ðŸš€Recommender-System-Ecommerce
## Overview
It is a real-time recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system provides product recommendations based on the userâ€™s recent history and ratings using Hybrid Filtering, which leverages collaborative and content-based filtering.
# Implementation
## Hybrid Recommendation Implementation (hybrid_recommendations())
The hybrid recommendation system combines Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering to provide accurate and personalized product recommendations.
### How It Works?
1. Content-Based Filtering: Finds similar products using TF-IDF and cosine similarity based on product tags.
2. Collaborative Filtering: Uses SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to recommend products based on user interactions.
3. Hybrid Approach: Merges results from both methods, removes duplicates, and returns the top N recommendations.

## Content-Based Filtering (content_based_filter())
This method recommends products similar to a given item based on text similarity (TF-IDF).

### Function Steps:
1. Extract product tags (e.g., categories, descriptions).
2. Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features.
3. Computes cosine similarity between items. 
Cosine similarity between two vectors **A** and **B** is calculated as:

$$
\text{cosine\_similarity}(A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
$$

Where:
- \( A \cdot B \) is the dot product of vectors **A** and **B**.
- \( \|A\| \) and \( \|B\| \) are the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of the vectors.

4. Cosine similarity measures the **angle between two vectors**, helping identify product similarity in **content-based filtering**.
5. Recommends the top N most similar products based on the selected item.

## Collaborative Filtering (collaborative_based_filter())
This method recommends products based on user-item interactions, using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Function Steps:
1. Trains an SVD model on user-product ratings.
2. Predicts missing ratings for products a user hasnâ€™t interacted with.
3. Sorts products based on predicted scores and recommends top N products.
